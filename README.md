## About the app
The simple app where a user ranks countries that they like the most.

## Problem
Users of similar UI reported that sometimes they can loss their progress. There were different reasons: session expiration, accidental click on link to another page etc. Also in real-life application a user fills the list gradually, in several steps because they haven't all data required for making choice at a single moment.
The app owner asked developers to find a solution that helps saving data as soon as it possible.
